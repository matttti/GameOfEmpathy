*** GTPL mode for Emacs ***

Copy gtpl-mode.el to your include path and add to your .emacs :

(autoload 'gtpl-mode "gtpl-mode" nil t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.gtpl$" . gtpl-mode) auto-mode-alist))




*** Flymake support ***

Flymake is a tool for evaluating your code in an external process instantly after you typed it.
It marks all warnings and errors found when done. These steps describes how to setup
flymake for GTPL.

1. Install not totally outdated versions of node.js and tidy (an html-verifyer) 

2. Copy flymakegtpl and verifygtpl.js to an executable path (like /bin ). 
You may need to make some path adjustments in the scripts by now ;-)

3. Add this to your .emacs:
(require 'flymake)
(defun flymake-gtpl-init ()
  (let* ((temp-file (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy
                     'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
         (local-file (file-relative-name
                      temp-file
                      (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
    (list "flymakegtpl" (list local-file))))

(add-to-list 'flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
             '("\\.gtpl\\'" flymake-gtpl-init))

(add-to-list 'flymake-err-line-patterns
                         '("line \\([0-9]+\\) column \\([0-9]+\\) - \\(Warning\\|Error\\): \\(.*\\)"
                           nil 1 2 4))
